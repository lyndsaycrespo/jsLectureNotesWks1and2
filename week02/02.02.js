git init in the cmd prompt in the folder you want to upload to git
git add . (adds everything in the current directory to a staging area - you can also type an individual file name)
git status 
git commit -m "my first commit"

if you modify a file after committing, you need to add it to the staging area again and then commit it again

go to github, log in, and create a new repository. once you fill in the info, push an existing repository from the cmd line. it will 
give you a cmd line statement that looks like this:
git remote add origin https://github.com/lyndsaycrespo/jsLectureNotesWks1and2.git (enter it into the cmd line)
it will give you another line as well that looks like this:
git push -u origin master (enter this into the cmd line as well)

let's make a change
check the status with git status
then git commit -m
then git push origin master
